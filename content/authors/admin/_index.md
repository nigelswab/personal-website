    Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Nigel learned how to channel his 
    competitive nature from a young age through hockey, an obsession that

    where he learned many valuable lessons on work-ethic, teamwork, and accountability.
    <br><br>
    Today, Nigel is an outgoing and passionate Mechanical Engineer who's seeking 
    new challenges after completing his B.Eng in Mechanical Engineering at 
    the University of Victoria. Throughout his degree, he attained 24-months of 
    co-op experience, served as a Vehicle Dynamics Lead and Chief Engineer for a
    student engineering club, and assisted with outreach programs for women in 
    STEM.
