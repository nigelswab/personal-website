    date_start: "2022-01-01"
    date_end: "2022-08-30"
    #      Zaber designs and manufactures precision motion control devices for a
    #      range of industries including optics, microscopy, life sciences, and
    #      industrial automation.
    overview: >-
      Created, conducted, and documented tests on electromechanical precision
      motion control devices to investigate performance issues, define specifications,
      or quantify capabilities. This process regularly included developing testing
      systems and involved mechanical, electrical, and control system design.

    details: >-
      * Improved the speed and thrust capabilities of the linear thrust
        tester by 55% and 150%, respectively, through electromechanical
        design, component specification, and Python scripting.
      * Improved sampling rate of linear thrust tester by 350% using
        threading while adding further data measurements such as stage
        position.
      * Identified a thrust-bearing preload issue in the manufacturing
        process through investigative testing.
      * Investigated and identified thermal errors in high-precision
        stage testing introduced by testing setup and procedure.
        Collaborated to improve thermal stability by modifying testing
        procedures and equipment.

  - title: "Mechanical Engineering Co-op"
    company: "Vivitro Labs"

    location: "Victoria, BC"
    date_start: "2021-09-01"
    date_end: "2021-12-31"
    overview: >-
      Collaborated as a part of the R&D team to design, test, and analyze
      mechanical and electrical parts and systems for prosthetic heart valve
      testing equipment. This included defining design objectives and constraints,
      creating parts and drawings in Solidworks CAD, coordinating with machine shops,
      along with using manual mills and lathes, to manufacture prototypes,
      and developing tests to investigate prototype performance.
    details: >-
      * Designed and specified a high-speed camera system (lens, mounting,
        and lighting) for swift and repeatable installation across multiple
        prosthetic heart accelerated wear-testers.
      * Designed, manufactured, and tested fluid flow and compliance
        modifications to reduce hydraulic shock in a prototype accelerated
        wear tester.
      * Created, reviewed, and submitted drawings for manufacturing using
        SolidWorks CAD.
      * Performed vibration simulation and analysis using SolidWorks and
        calculations in Microsoft Excel.

    overview: >-
      Under the immediate supervision of a machinist
      with over 30 years of experience, and a professional engineer,
      I provided machining assistance in the Mechanical Engineering
      department's machining facility. Additionally, I provided guidance to
      undergraduate and graduate students with respect to design and drawings.
    details: >-
      * Assisted undergraduate and graduate students with design and
        research projects.
      * Fabricated several parts to high tolerances with both CNC and
        manual mills and lathes.
      * Operated the waterjet, laser cutting, and laser welding machines.
