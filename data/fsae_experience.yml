title: "Student Club Experience"
subtitle: >-
  <p>
  In the first weeks of my engineering degree, I joined
  <a style="color: hsl(339, 90%, 68%)!important;" href="https://fsae.engr.uvic.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    UVic Formula Racing (UVFR)
  </a>,
  a student engineering club that designs, builds, and tests a
  open-wheeled race car annually. The club competes in
  <a style="color: hsl(339, 90%, 68%)!important;" href="https://www.fsaeonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formula SAE (FSAE)</a>,
  the largest collegiate design competition in the world that was created to
  supplement student's education by providing real-world constraints and
  hands-on skill often neglected by class. I spent 5 years dedicating most of
  my free time developing both technical and soft skills in various roles
  with UVFR.
