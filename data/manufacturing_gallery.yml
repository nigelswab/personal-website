  Through <a href="#experience"> co-ops </a> and involvement in
  <a href="#student_club_experience">UVFR</a>, I gained valuable experience
  manufacturing components and assemblies with a variety of materials and
  methods. I have experience using CNC and manual mills and
  lathes, laser cutters, water jets, and a variety of hand-tools.
  Additionally, I have had experience with carbon fiber layups and laser welding.
  Below is a small sample of components and assemblies I've made
  over the past several years.
